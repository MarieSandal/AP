##### The title of my work is: Drawing with Checkboxes

I like the idea of using objects in programming, because it makes everything easier and look neater, so you don't end up getting confused/overwhelmed looking at your code. Unfortunately this time around I didn't end up making my own objects. I only used imputs that are already made in the .dom library. 

In my work I used checkboxes to create a 'drawing canvas'. I did this, because when I looked at a lot of the form art, I thought to myself, that a big part of the art is when the user creates something with the different imputs. Becuase a big part of my work is centered around the user I let the user change the background color, which also changes the look of the checkboxes. If you want to make a peaceful looking drawing or a darker more contrastful drawing. I chose to put in some random text to let the user know, that I wanted the person behind the screen to actively participate in my work.
