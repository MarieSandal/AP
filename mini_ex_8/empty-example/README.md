##### Chosen coding challenge: Purple Rain
The new function I added in my program was sound. Since the day I struggled with making sound work together with my throbber, I've wanted to create something with sound and try it out again. Inspired by my throbber, I wanted to create something that would be calming to watch. Therefore I also changed the colour and opacity of the raindrops + background.

I don't think this week's mini exercise was the most stressful one. I think we got a chance to both look at the code and get a good understanding of it, but also work with flowcharts in relation to coding, which I think was really helpful. 

As mentioned above, with flowcharts you get a better idea of what you can do with the code, but you also need to think about who you are trying to communicate with through the flowchart. I tried making a "simpler" flowchart, where you could get a good idea of what my code is capable of, but not going too much into details.
