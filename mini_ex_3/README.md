##Mini Exercise 3

Describe a bit about your throbber design (your concept and execution):

My concept behind my throbber was to a critique the impatience you find amongst users of technology. We are used to everything going so quickly, that when we have to wait a few seconds we get confused, frustrated or bored.  As Donald A. Norman mentions we need an instant feedback, if we do not want to get frustrated. My throbber challenges this thought, because it just focuses on being calming and do not have the actual waiting time in focus. It is not trying to show, when it’s time estimated that it’ll be done, but instead wants to comment on the impatience, people experience for wasting 3 seconds. 
Making my program, I first played around with the programming tool, where I found out how to make the snowflakes or sparks (you choose your own interpretation), using the push and pop function. After that, I made my background with the sky and the ocean.

How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?

With programming everything you do, can change the digital culture. For example when they made the average operating systems a lot more user friendly, it had the consequence that we now have difficulties with basic coding or encountering issues. The throbber is used as a feedback telling you that you are loading something, but it needs time to load. You can then make the waiting time seem shorter with some more fun options of throbbers.
