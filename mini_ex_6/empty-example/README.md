## Title of my work: Colors of my thoughts

My work is a result of my frustration, which is very noticeable if you look at the text written in the program. The program itself is simple, but the colors represent all of the different thoughts that went through my mind, trying to find a good idea for this mini exercise. I wanted to make something with meaning and something that represents something. But then again, sometimes I actually like, when things are just pretty and aesthetically pleasing. Just like our guest lecture Tobias’ programs. I liked the fact that they were nice to look at, and sometimes I believe that we should be able to make art or aesthetically pleasing things that shouldn’t be questioned or explained. This is why I made my program very loud and perhaps at times even annoying to look at - but at times it also looks like something that could be in an art gallery marked as abstract art. 

# What are the rules that you have employed in your program?
The rules that I implemented in my code were:
-	If the radius of the circle was less than 2.5 then the circle will increase in size. When the radius reaches 2.5, it will start to decrease in size.
-	While increasing in size I made an array of text that would be shown. When the circles start decreasing in size, the random text will change to another array of text. The font will also change from the regular Arial to Arial Black.
-	My next rule was for every ellipse and the background to have a random color that will change per frame.

## By using some of the concepts from the article - Generative Art Theory, can you discuss how is your program expressed the notion of generativity? 
My work express the notion of generativity in the sense that it makes a pattern, that the programmer/viewer doesn’t have the control of. The pattern in my program is completely random in terms of colors and the patterns are somewhat also random. I believe that in my case the author of the program is both the program itself, but also me as a programmer. Because I designed this program to create a lot (!) of circles and determined, when to stop the growth, and to make them decrease in size again. The text I put in my work is a clear sign of someone designing the program. It’s my thoughts and frustration that this program actually expresses. Although I do think that the randomness in colors, both in the background and in the circles makes every load of the program a unique and different experience.
