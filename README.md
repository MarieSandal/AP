Learning to code in p5.js was actually a very good experience. I think it helps a lot that there are so many tutorials and sample codes that you can use, when you are new to programming. My mini exercise 2 is still very basic, because of my lack of experience, but I don’t think I’m as terrified now as I was going into this course. First, I wanted him to look complete, but then I figured that in some programs a real glitch could be, when parts of a face are missing or misplaced. I then moved his eyes away from his face to make the glitch noticeable. 

•	What constitutes a program? 

When you are new to programming it’s essential for your programming experience to understand the coding language. There are these rules that determine if your program is going to work or not. After you understand the language you then have the possibility of trying to do more impressive things. I believe that it's when you reach that point that you can feel all the hard work has paid off.

•	Reflect on the notion of error (what is error to you?)

When I think of error I think of something that goes wrong. Sometimes errors can be fatal and other times they don’t interfere much with the process. They also have different time lengths, some errors only appear for milliseconds and others will not disappear. But sometimes people make errors on purpose. With the errors you are able to make a statement.
