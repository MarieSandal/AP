This is my try at showcasing error with a cartoon character. I started creating the canvas and creating my stickman. I used ellipses to make the eyes and the headshape. Then I used lines to create his eyebrows and figure. First, I wanted him to look complete, but then I figured that in some programs a real glitch could be, when parts of a face are missing or misplaced. I then moved his eyes away from his face to make the glitch noticeable. 

•	What constitutes a program? 

A program often has a purpose. You want to do something with the program. It doesn’t matter if it’s to make someone laugh or to speculate about things. 

•	Reflect on the notion of error (what is error to you?)

When I think of error I think of something that goes wrong. Sometimes errors can be fatal and other times they don’t interfere much with the process. They also have different time lengths, some errors only appear for milliseconds and others will not disappear.
