### •	Which API have you chosen? and Why?
We chose the Open Weather Map API, because we had a bit of trouble with using the twitter api, which only allowed us to get 100 tweets. We couldn’t find out how to get around it, so instead we chose to make a “purple rain” program, which is able to showcase how rainy a certain city is. This means that we’re acquiring data from a weather API, checking the id which represents the weather conditions and then checking those values with values for different intensities of rain fall, and then representing it visually on the screen.
### •	Can you describe your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, using and representing data?
The documentation on the website for the API, said that one of the data values returned, represented the rainfall in the past 3 hours, which would have been ideal for this application, however that value wasn't returned at all within the response, so we had to gauge the amount of rainfall based on the weather id returned where, different values represented light, medium and heavy rainfall, so for example the difference between light and medium rainfall is more sudden than if it were calculated from a numerical values of rainfall in the last 3 hours
### •	What is your reflection on the aesthetics of (big) data?
In relation to the aesthetics of big data, it’s interesting to see, how some data is available for almost everyone, and other data is kept hidden. We all know that the things we share on Facebook will be registered, but we are not aware, that the things we end up not sharing will still be stored as information. If it’s our mailbox that saves the text that we’ve just written, we don’t seem to care as much, because it’s a useful feature for us. But when it’s Facebook, we don’t need it stored, and we don’t even get the chance to use it. We find this very interesting and something to maybe analyze further.
