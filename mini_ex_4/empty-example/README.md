The flying balloon is my try at making a flying object that will react to movements. If I had advanced the program more, I could see it being a fun little game to play, while waiting for a loading screen to be done. 
The balloon demonstrates the notion of feedback, because it continues to fly up, and when it reaches the top, another balloon will start flying from the bottom.
The balloon also reacts to the movements of the mouse - so it's the users job to choose the route for the balloon.
